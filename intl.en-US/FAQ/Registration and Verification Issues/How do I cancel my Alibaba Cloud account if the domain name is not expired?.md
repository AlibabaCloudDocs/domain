# How do I cancel my Alibaba Cloud account if the domain name is not expired?

This article will introduce you to the method of canceling an Alibaba Cloud account when the domain name has not expired.

## Issue

When you log off an Alibaba Cloud account, the system performs an **account cancellation information check** on your current account. After the check is completed, the system prompts that **there is a valid domain name business under your account, and the account cannot be deleted**.

## Possible cause

A valid domain name exists under your account. The domain name has not expired or been canceled, so you cannot cancel the current Alibaba Cloud account.

## Solution

-   Method 1: Transfer domain name

    Transfer valid domain names under your current account to other Alibaba cloud accounts. domain names that have completed Real-name authentication will not be affected. after the transfer is completed, you can re-execute the account cancellation operation. For more information about transferring domain names to other Alibaba Cloud accounts, see [Transfer domains to another Alibaba Cloud account](/intl.en-US/Domain name transfer/Transfer domains to another Alibaba Cloud account.md).

-   Method 2: Sell domain names

    If your domain name has not expired, you can try to sell the domain name and cancel the Alibaba Cloud account again after the domain name is sold successfully.

-   Method 3: Wait for the domain name to expire

    If your domain name has not expired, you can wait for the domain name to expire before canceling your Alibaba Cloud account.

-   Method 4: Log out the domain name

    You can submit a domain name cancellation ticket, and the Alibaba Cloud commissioner will cancel the valid domain name under your current account. After the domain name cancellation is completed, you can cancel the account again.

    **Note:**

    -   After the domain name is successfully canceled, the remaining unexpired fees will not be refunded.
    -   If the domain name has been filed, the website that has been successfully filed after the domain name is canceled will become an empty shell website.
