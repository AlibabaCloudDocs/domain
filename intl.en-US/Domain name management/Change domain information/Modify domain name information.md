# Modify domain name information

If your domain name information such as the registrant email address or mobile phone number changes, or if the domain name administrator changes, you must modify the domain name information in a timely manner to ensure information accuracy. This topic describes how to modify domain name information.

## Background information

Domain name information includes information of the registrant, administrator, billing contact, and technical contact. If you need to transfer the domain name ownership or modify certificate information of the domain name registrant, see [Transfer domain name ownership](/intl.en-US/Domain name management/Change domain information/Transfer domain name ownership.md). Follow the instructions in this topic to modify registrant information such as the address, email address, and mobile phone number.

Based on the [transfer policy](https://www.icann.org/resources/pages/transfer-policy-2016-06-01-en) issued by the Internet Corporation for Assigned Names and Numbers \(ICANN\), you cannot transfer a domain name from the current registrar within 60 days after you transfer the ownership of the domain name. If you need to transfer the domain name from Alibaba Cloud to another registrar within 60 days after you transfer the domain name ownership, select **Disable "Domain names cannot be transferred out of Alibaba Cloud within 60 days of successful modification"** when you modify domain name information. Otherwise, the transfer-out request will fail.

## Procedure

1.  Log on to the [Alibaba Cloud Domains console](https://dc.console.aliyun.com/?spm=a2c1d.8251217.1002.19.7e29eef5kAnBeP#/domain/list).

2.  On the **Domain Names** page, find the domain name for which you want to modify information and click **Manage** in the **Action** column.

3.  In the left-side navigation pane, click **Info Modification**.

4.  Click the **Registrant Info Modification**, **Admin Contact Modification**, **Billing Contact Modification**, or **Tech Contact Modification** tab as required.

    **Note:** If you transfer the domain name ownership on the **Registrant Info Modification** tab, the system will send an email to the email addresses of both the original and new registrants.

5.  Modify the domain name information as required.


## Modify the registration information of an internationalized domain name

**Scenario: The information of an internationalized domain name changes or is invalid.**

Based on the [WHOIS Data Reminder Policy](https://whois.icann.org/en/whois-data-reminder-policy-wdrp) of ICANN and the domain name registration agreement, Alibaba Cloud, as a domain name registrar, will send a notification email to the domain name registrant when the registration information is updated. Check the domain name information in a timely manner. If you find that the domain name information has changed or is invalid, update the domain name information as soon as possible to ensure that your domain name information is correct.

**Impact of not updating domain name information promptly**

If your domain name information is invalid and is not updated in a timely manner, you may not receive important domain name notifications pertaining to security threats. Based on the provisions on domain name registration, if you provide false or invalid registration information or do not update your registration information in a timely manner, your domain name may be deleted.

**Prerequisites for modifying registration information about internationalized domain names**

The domain name is in the domain name list in the Alibaba Cloud Domains console.

**Modification and instructions**

You can modify the registration information of an internationalized domain name, including the information of the registrant, administrator, billing contact, and technical contact.
