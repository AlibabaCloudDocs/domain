# Transfer domain name ownership

If the registrant of a domain name changes due to reasons such as domain name trading or Internet Content Provider \(ICP\) filing, you must transfer the ownership of the domain name to the actual domain name registrant as soon as possible. This topic describes how to transfer domain name ownership in different scenarios and the precautions associated with ownership transfer.

## Differences between ownership transfer and other situations

If the registrant of a domain name needs to be changed from Person A to Person B due to reasons such as domain name trading or ICP filing, the ownership of the domain name must be officially transferred. If the contact information of a domain name registrant changes, the registrant needs only to update the domain name information. For more information, see [Modify domain name information](/intl.en-US/Domain name management/Change domain information/Modify domain name information.md). The transfer of domain name ownership is not involved in this situation. After the ownership of a domain name is transferred, the Alibaba Cloud account of the registrant will not be changed.

**Note:** Before you transfer your domain name ownership to another registrant, you must check when your domain name expires in the [Domains console](https://dc.console.aliyun.com/next/index?spm=5176.12818093.0.1.488716d0w2MX8e#/domain/list/all-domain). You cannot transfer the ownership of an expired domain name. If you want to perform the transfer, you must renew the domain name before the transfer. For more information, see [Renew a domain name](/intl.en-US/Domain name management/Renew domain names/Renew a domain name.md).

For example, the enterprise name is changed from DocExample to DocExample02.

|-   The contact information of the individual or enterprise used for real-name verification for the domain name is changed.

For example, the mobile phone number or email address of the individual who has passed real-name verification for the domain name is changed.

**Note:** If the name or ID card number of the individual is changed, ownership transfer is required.

-   The office location of the enterprise used for real-name verification for the domain name is changed.

For example, the office location is changed from Xihu District, Hangzhou, Zhejiang to Binjiang District, Hangzhou, Zhejiang.

**Note:** If the name of the enterprise is changed, ownership transfer is required.

## Review time

When the ownership of a domain name is being transferred to a new registrant, the time required to review the materials submitted for real-name verification is usually three to five business days. The specific review time varies in the following situations:

-   Transfer the ownership of multiple domain names by using a registrant profile that has passed real-name verification:
    -   Non-CNNIC domain names: The verification process can be completed within a short period of time. CNNIC is the abbreviation of China Internet Network Information Center.
    -   CNNIC domain names such as .cn: If you transfer the ownership of a CNNIC domain name by using a registrant profile that has passed real-name verification, little information and few materials are required for review. However, CNNIC still reviews the domain name information and real-name verification materials. The review process usually takes three to five business days.
-   Transfer the ownership of a single domain name by using a registrant profile that has passed real-name verification:

    After you select a registrant profile that has passed real-name verification, you must still enter your certificate number and upload materials for real-name verification to transfer the ownership. The review process usually takes three to five business days.

-   Transfer the ownership of special domain names with suffixes such as .gov.cn: Registrants of special domain names cannot be changed online. The time required to review real-name verification materials varies based on the actual situation.

**Note:** The review results require about three business days to be synchronized to the database of the Ministry of Industry and Information Technology \(MIIT\). After the ownership of a domain name is transferred to you, we recommend that you wait for three business days before you apply for an ICP filing. Otherwise, your application may be denied.

## Materials required to transfer domain name ownership

If you want to transfer the ownership of a domain name to a new registrant, you must provide materials of the new registrant for real-name verification. The certificates or documents of the current registrant are not required. Before an ownership transfer, we recommend that you check the type of your domain name registrant or your domain name type and prepare the required materials in advance. This facilitates the transfer.

The following materials are required to transfer the ownership of both individual and organization domain names:

-   For the materials required to transfer the ownership of individual domain names, see [t14318.md\#section\_mvq\_bzv\_12b](/intl.en-US/Real-name authentication for domains/Materials required for real-name verification.md).
-   For the materials required to transfer the ownership of organization domain names, see [Organization registrants](/intl.en-US/Real-name authentication for domains/Materials required for real-name verification.md).
