# Change DNS servers for a domain name

If a domain name is registered with Alibaba Cloud, the domain name is resolved by Alibaba Cloud DNS servers by default. If you want to use your self-developed DNS servers or third-party DNS servers to resolve the domain name, perform the operations described in this topic.

-   The domain name is registered with or transferred to Alibaba Cloud. If you transfer the domain name from Alibaba Cloud to another domain name registrar, you must change DNS servers at the new registrar.
-   You have your self-developed DNS servers or third-party DNS servers.
-   The domain name is valid. If your domain name is expired, you must renew it. For more information, see [Renew a domain name](/intl.en-US/Domain name management/Renew domain names/Renew a domain name.md).
