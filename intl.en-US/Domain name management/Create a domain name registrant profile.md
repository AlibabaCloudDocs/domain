# Create a domain name registrant profile

Alibaba Cloud Domains allows you to create domain name registrant profiles that can be used to specify registrant information during registration, transfer, and trade of domain names. We recommend that you create a registrant profile, and submit it for email and real-name verification as soon as possible.

**Note:** After real-name verification for a registrant profile is approved, you can use the profile as a template when you register domain names, modify domain name registrant information, or purchase domain names. The use of registrant profiles saves time and maximizes efficiency by eliminating the need for repeated submission of information and materials by the applicant. In addition, most domain name registrars recognize review results of registrant profiles, which improves the review efficiency.

## Registrant profile description

Alibaba Cloud allows you to create two types of registrant profiles: common profiles and China Internet Network Information Center \(CNNIC\) profiles. You can use the registrant profiles to register domain names and transfer domain name ownership.

|Profile type|Scenario|Precaution|
|:-----------|:-------|:---------|
|Common profile|You can use a common profile to perform operations such as domain name registration, domain name ownership transfer, and domain name transfer-in on domain names except .cn, .中国, .公司, and .网络 domain names.|After you create a common profile, verify the registrant email. Otherwise, you cannot use the profile to register a domain name.|
|CNNIC profile|You can use a CNNIC profile to perform operations such as domain name registration, domain name ownership transfer, domain name transfer-in, and real-name verification on .cn, .中国, .公司, and .网络 domain names from the CNNIC registrar.|-   After you create a CNNIC profile, verify the registrant email. Otherwise, you cannot use the profile to register a domain name.
-   After you create a CNNIC profile, complete real-name verification. Otherwise, the .cn, .中国, .公司, and .网络 domain names registered by using the profile are in the serverHold state and are inaccessible. |
