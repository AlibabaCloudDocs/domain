# Naming rules for domain names

Domain names with different suffixes may be subject to different naming rules. You must follow the corresponding domain naming rules to register a domain name and pass the domain name review. This topic describes the naming rules for Chinese domain names, English domain names, and special domain names. You can study the corresponding rules based on your business requirements and plan your domain name.

## Naming rules for Chinese domain names

A Chinese domain name must comply with the following rules:

-   The Chinese domain name must contain at least one Chinese character and can contain letters, digits, and hyphens \(-\). The letters are not case-sensitive.
-   The domain name must be registered in simplified or traditional Chinese. For most domain name registries, a domain name in simplified Chinese is equivalent to its traditional Chinese form. However, if a domain name is registered in simplified Chinese, the equivalent domain name in traditional Chinese can no longer be registered. The reverse operation also applies.
-   The domain name cannot start or end with a hyphen \(-\), plus sign \(+\), at sign \(@\), ampersand \(&\), or space.
-   The domain name cannot contain only letters or digits.
-   The domain name cannot contain consecutive hyphens \(--\) or only one hyphen \(-\). A hyphen \(-\) cannot be placed at the beginning or end of a domain name.
-   The Punycode for the domain name cannot exceed 63 characters in length.
-   Some domain names do not support Chinese characters, such as .com.cn, .net.cn, and .org.cn domain names.
-   If the domain name contains a special word that indicates China, such as "中国", "国家", "中华", and "全国", it must be registered by the corresponding trademark holder of an organization. Individuals or non-trademark holder organizations cannot apply to register the domain name without prior authorization.

## Naming rules for English domain names

An English domain name must comply with the following rules:

-   The domain name can contain letters, digits, and hyphens \(-\). The letters are not case-sensitive. It cannot contain spaces or special characters, such as exclamation points \(!\), dollar signs \($\), ampersands \(&\), and question marks \(?\).
-   The domain name cannot contain consecutive hyphens \(--\) or only one hyphen \(-\). A hyphen \(-\) cannot be placed at the beginning or end of a domain name.
-   The domain name cannot exceed 63 characters in length.
-   If the domain name contains a special word that indicates China, such as "中国", "国家", "中华", and "全国", it must be registered by the corresponding trademark holder of an organization. Individuals or non-trademark holder organizations cannot apply to register the domain name without prior authorization.

## Naming rules for .中国, .cn, .公司, and .网络 domain names

The *Notice on Adjusting the Standards for Auditing Domain Names* that is issued by the China Internet Network Information Center \(CNNIC\) stipulates the following conditions. If the word "中国", "国家", "中华", or "全国" is used in a .中国, .cn, .公司, or .网络 domain name that is registered for an organization, the registration of the domain name must be applied for by the corresponding trademark holder. Individuals or non-trademark holder organization cannot apply to register the domain name without prior authorization.

For example, the registration of the 中国律师协会.中国 domain name can be applied for only by the corresponding trademark holder, the All China Lawyers Association. This organization must submit real-name verification materials within five days after the domain name is registered and pass the CNNIC qualification review. Then, this organization can use the domain name. If the registration application is submitted by an individual or a non-trademark holder organization, the application will not pass the CNNIC qualification review and the corresponding domain name will be directly deleted.
