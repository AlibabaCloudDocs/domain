# Naming rules for domain names

Domain names with different suffixes may be subject to different naming rules. You must follow the corresponding naming rules to register a domain name and pass the domain name review. This topic describes the naming rules for Chinese domain names, English domain names, and special domain names. You can study the corresponding rules based on your business requirements and plan your domain name.

**Note:**

-   If a domain name to be registered for an organization contains a special word that indicates China, such as "中国", "国家", "中华", and "全国", only a trademark holder organization can submit an application to register the domain name. Individuals or non-trademark holder organizations must obtain prior authorization before they can register such a domain name.
-   If a domain name contains prohibited characters that are stipulated by the Measures for the Administration of Internet Domain Names of China, the domain name cannot be registered or pass the domain name review in mainland China. In this case, you must transfer the domain name to a registrar outside mainland China.

## Naming rules for Chinese domain names

A Chinese domain name must comply with the following rules:

-   The Chinese domain name must contain at least one Chinese character and can contain letters, digits, and hyphens \(-\). The letters are not case-sensitive.
-   You cannot register the domain name in both simplified and traditional Chinese.

    **Note:**

    -   Most domain name registries provide equivalent protection for domain names registered in simplified and traditional Chinese. You can register a domain name in either simplified or traditional Chinese, but not both.
    -   If a domain name is registered in simplified Chinese, you must cancel the domain name before you can register the equivalent domain name in traditional Chinese. The reverse operation also applies.

-   The domain name cannot start or end with a hyphen \(-\), plus sign \(+\), at sign \(@\), ampersand \(&\), or space.
-   The domain name cannot contain only letters or digits.
-   The domain name cannot contain consecutive hyphens \(--\) or consist of only one hyphen \(-\). A hyphen \(-\) cannot be placed at the beginning or end of a domain name.
-   The Punycode for the domain name cannot exceed 63 characters in length.
-   Some domain names do not support Chinese characters, such as .com.cn, .net.cn, and .org.cn domain names.

## Naming rules for English domain names

An English domain name must comply with the following rules:

-   The domain name can contain letters, digits, and hyphens \(-\). The letters are not case-sensitive. It cannot contain spaces or special characters, such as exclamation points \(!\), dollar signs \($\), ampersands \(&\), and question marks \(?\).
-   The domain name cannot contain consecutive hyphens \(--\) or consist of only one hyphen \(-\). A hyphen \(-\) cannot be placed at the beginning or end of a domain name.

## Naming rules for .中国, .cn, .公司, and .网络 domain names

The *Notice on Adjusting the Standards for Auditing Domain Names* that is issued by the China Internet Network Information Center \(CNNIC\) stipulates the following conditions: If the word "中国", "国家", "中华", or "全国" is used in a .中国, .cn, .公司, or .网络 domain name to be registered for an organization, only a trademark holder organization can submit an application to register the domain name. Individuals or non-trademark holder organizations must obtain prior authorization before they can register such a domain name.

For example, only the All China Lawyers Association can submit an application to register the 中国律师协会.中国 domain name. The organization must submit real-name verification materials within five days after the domain name is registered. The organization can use the domain name after the CNNIC qualification review is passed. If the registration application is submitted by an individual or a non-trademark holder organization, the application will not pass the CNNIC qualification review and the corresponding domain name will be directly deleted.
