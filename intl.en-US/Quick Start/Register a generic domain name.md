# Register a generic domain name

Alibaba Cloud provides rich domain name registration services. You can register a domain name on the Alibaba Cloud Domains service platform.

## Procedure

**Note:**

-   The registrars at the Alibaba Cloud International site \(alibabacloud.com\) are registrars outside China. You cannot apply for an ICP filing for a domain name registered at the Alibaba Cloud International site \(alibabacloud.com\). If you want to deploy your services such as websites in mainland China, you must register your domain name and complete the ICP filing for your website at the Alibaba Cloud China site \(aliyun.com\). Otherwise, your website may be inaccessible in mainland China.
-   The procedure to register a premium domain name is similar to that to register a generic domain name. You can register a premium domain name by performing the steps described in this topic.
-   You are not allowed to use a RAM user to register or renew a domain name in the Alibaba Cloud Domains console or by calling Domains API operations. If you want to register or renew a domain name, use your Alibaba Cloud account.

1.  Search for a domain name.

    1.  Go to the [Domain Name Registration](https://www.alibabacloud.com/zh/domain) page at the Alibaba Cloud International site \(alibabacloud.com\).

    2.  Enter a domain name in the search box and click **Search**.

    3.  Select a suffix from the drop-down list and click **Search**.

        -   If the status of the domain name in the search results is **Taken**, the domain name has been registered by another user. In this case, you must choose another domain name or suffix for registration.

            **Note:** If the domain name that you want to register has been registered, you can choose a domain name with another suffix for registration. For example, you want to register the forexample.com domain name, but it has been registered by another user. In this case, you can choose a domain name that uses another suffix, such as forexample.net, forexample.info, or forexample.xin.

        -   If the status of a domain name is not **Taken**, the domain name is not registered, and you can add the domain name to your shopping cart for registration.
2.  Select a domain name from the search results and add the domain name to your shopping cart.

    1.  Find a domain name that is not in the Taken state and click **Add to cart**.

    2.  In the **Shopping Cart** panel, select the domain name that you want to purchase, specify the purchase period, and then click **Buy Now**.

3.  Add the related information about the domain name registrant and confirm the terms of service.

    1.  On the **Confirm Order** page, add information about the domain name registrant by using one of the following methods:

        -   If you have created a registrant profile, select the profile.
        -   If you have not created a registrant profile, or you want to add a new domain name registrant, click **Create Registrant Profile** to create a profile. After you create a registrant profile, select it on the Confirm Order page.
        **Note:** If you are registering a .cn domain name, and you have completed real-name verification for the registrant specified in the selected profile, you do not need to perform real-name verification again after the .cn domain name is registered. If you have not completed real-name verification for the registrant specified in the selected profile, you must complete the verification as soon as possible after the registration. For more information, see [Real-name verification for .cn domain names](/intl.en-US/Real-name authentication for domains/Real-name verification for .cn domain names.md).

    2.  Read and select the terms of service, and click **Place Order**.

4.  Complete the payment.

    Make sure that the domain name information is correct, select a payment method, and then click **Purchase**.


After the payment is complete, the state of your order becomes **Processing**. When the state changes to **Successful**, the domain name has been registered.

**Note:** Premium domain names and reserved domain names are more valuable than other domain names. Therefore, they are excluded from all promotional activities.

For more information about domain name registration, see [FAQ about domain name registration](/intl.en-US/FAQ/Registration and Verification Issues/FAQ about domain name registration.md).

After you register a .cn domain name, you must submit the same information to complete real-name verification. Otherwise, the domain name does not work. For more information, see [Real-name verification for .cn domain names](/intl.en-US/Real-name authentication for domains/Real-name verification for .cn domain names.md).
