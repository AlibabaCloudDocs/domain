## Register a domain name

If you need to use a domain name to provide website or email services, you can register the domain name on the [Domain Name Registration](https://wanwang.aliyun.com/) page. After you register a domain name, you must complete real-name verification, apply for an ICP filing, and enable domain name resolution for the domain name. Then, your domain name becomes accessible and you can provide services by using the domain name.

-   **Register a domain name**

    Alibaba Cloud allows you to register a variety of types of domain names. You can select a suffix for the domain name to register on the [Domain Name Registration](https://wanwang.aliyun.com/) page. For more information, see [Register a generic domain name](/intl.en-US/Quick Start/Register a generic domain name.md).

-   **Apply for an ICP filing**

    You must apply for an ICP filing for a domain name before you can use the domain name to provide Internet information services in mainland China.

    -   If you run a website without an ICP filing, you will be fined and your website will be shut down. If you need to use the registered domain name to provide Internet information services, you must apply for an ICP filing for the domain name in the [Alibaba Cloud ICP Filing System](https://beian.aliyun.com/order/index.htm).
    -   If you need to point the domain name to a website that provides commercial services, you must apply for an ICP license after you obtain an ICP filing.
    -   The *Measures for Security Protection Administration of the International Networking of Computer Information Networks* stipulate that, after you obtain an ICP filing for your website, you must log on to the [National Internet Security Management Service Platform](http://www.beian.gov.cn/portal/index?spm=a2c4g.11186623.2.1.SRC9LP) and submit a Public Security Bureau \(PSB\) filing application within 30 days after the launch of your website.
-   **Enable domain name resolution**

    You can enable domain name resolution for a domain name after you register it on Alibaba Cloud, complete real-name verification, and apply for an ICP filing for the domain name. The domain name becomes accessible after you enable domain name resolution for it. Alibaba Cloud DNS provides you with stable, secure, and fast resolution services.

## Manage a domain name

After you register or purchase a domain name, you must perform routine management and security management on the domain name to ensure that the domain name can provide services in a stable and safe manner.

-   **Perform routine management**
    -   **Renew or redeem a domain name**

        You must pay attention to the validity period of your domain name. Alibaba Cloud sends notification messages to your mobile phone number and email address when your domain name is about to expire. We recommend that you renew your domain name before it expires. For more information, see [Renew a domain name](/intl.en-US/Domain name management/Renew domain names/Renew a domain name.md). After your domain name expires, it enters a 30-day grace period. If you do not renew your domain name within the grace period, you may need to redeem the domain name at a higher price. For more information, see [Redeem a domain name](/intl.en-US/Domain name management/Redeem a domain name.md).

    -   **Manage domain name information**

        Alibaba Cloud provides you with convenient information management services related to your domain name. You can create and manage registrant profiles in the Domains console to facilitate domain name registration. You can also modify domain name information, such as the email address of the registrant, in the Domains console. For more information, see [Create a domain name registrant profile](/intl.en-US/Domain name management/Create a domain name registrant profile.md) and [Modify domain name information](/intl.en-US/Domain name management/Change domain information/Modify domain name information.md).

    For more information about the practices and operations related to security management, see [Best practices for domain name security](/intl.en-US/Domain security FAQs/Best practices for domain name security.md).

-   **Manage authorization**
    -   If you need to authorize other users to perform basic management operations on your domain name, you can use the Resource Access Management \(RAM\) service to grant required permissions in the [RAM console](https://ram.console.aliyun.com/).
    -   **Domains allows only a HiChina agent account to enable a separate console for a domain name.** If your Alibaba Cloud account is not a HiChina agent account, we recommend that you manage authorization in the [RAM console](https://ram.console.aliyun.com/).
    -   If your Alibaba Cloud account is not a HiChina agent account and a separate console has been enabled for your domain name, you can continue to use the console. However, if you disable the console for your domain name, you cannot enable the console again.
