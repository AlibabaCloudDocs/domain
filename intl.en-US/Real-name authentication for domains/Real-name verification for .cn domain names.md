# Real-name verification for .cn domain names

You must complete real-name verification after you register a .cn domain name. This topic describes real-name verification for China Internet Network Information Center \(CNNIC\) templates and .cn domain names.

**Email verification** is complete for the domain name registrant.

.cn is the country code top-level domain \(ccTLD\) for the People's Republic of China. .cn domain names use .cn as the suffix, including domain names that are directly registered at the second or third level.

cn indicates the People's Republic of China. CNNIC is the domain name registry that manages the .cn domain name system and the central database.

## Real-name verification for CNNIC templates

If you have created a CNNIC template but have not completed real-name verification for the template, perform the following steps to complete real-name verification. Then, you can directly use this template to register other .cn domain names.

1.  Log on to the [Domains console](https://dc.console.aliyun.com/).

2.  In the left-side navigation pane, click **Registrant Profiles**. On the page that appears, click the **Cnnic template** tab.

3.  On the Cnnic template tab, find the template that requires real-name verification and click **No audit** in the **Verified Status** column.

    **Note:** Make sure that the email address of the registrant has been verified before you submit the verification information.

4.  On the **Template real-name verification** page, select a certification type, enter your certificate number, and then upload a scanned copy or an image of your certificate.

    -   For more information about how to enter the required information and upload the real-name verification materials for organization domain name registrants, see [Examples of real-name verification information for organization registrants](/intl.en-US/Real-name authentication for domains/Real-name authentication examples/Examples of real-name verification information for organization registrants.md).
5.  Verify that the information is correct and then click **Save**.

    **Note:**

    -   The submitted information will be verified by a third-party verification authority. The verification process takes three to five weekdays to complete.
    -   If your real-name verification information fails the verification, troubleshoot the failure by following the instructions provided in [Real-name verification failures and solutions](/intl.en-US/Real-name authentication for domains/Real-name verification failures and solutions.md).

## Real-name verification for domain names

If you have registered a .cn domain name but have not completed real-name verification for the domain name, perform the following steps to submit the required information for real-name verification:

**Note:**

-   If you have registered a. cn domain name at the Alibaba Cloud International site \(alibabacloud.com\), the domain name supports real-name verification but does not support Internet Content Provider \(ICP\) filing.
-   If real-name verification for a .cn domain name fails, troubleshoot the failure by using one of the following methods:
    -   Log on to the [Domains console](https://dc.console.aliyun.com/) and perform real-name verification on the .cn domain name again. You cannot directly modify the real-name verification information that fails the verification. Instead, you must delete the real-name verification information that fails the verification and submit real-name verification information again.
    -   Create a CNNIC template and perform real-name verification on the template. Use the CNNIC template when you perform real-name verification on the .cn domain name again. For more information, see [Real-name verification for CNNIC templates](#section_rdn_q41_ygb).

1.  Log on to the [Domains console](https://dc.console.aliyun.com/).

2.  On the **Domain Names** page, find the domain name on which you want to perform real-name verification and click **Manage** in the Action column. The **Basic Information** page appears.

    **Note:** Make sure that the email address of the registrant has been verified before you submit the verification information.

3.  In the left-side navigation pane, click **Real name verification**. On the page that appears, enter the required information and upload the required materials for real-name verification.

    -   For more information about how to enter the required information and upload the real-name verification materials for organization domain name registrants, see [Examples of real-name verification information for organization registrants](/intl.en-US/Real-name authentication for domains/Real-name authentication examples/Examples of real-name verification information for organization registrants.md).
4.  Verify that the information is correct and then click **Save**.
